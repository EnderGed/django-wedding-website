    If you cannot decide on a gift, here's a short list of things that we're positive they'll serve us well in our marriage.
    <br>
        If you chose one of them, please don't forget to mark it for others to see.

                    Although flowers are very beautiful, they wither and fade. We're going for a honeymoon trip almost right after the wedding, so unfortunately we won't even be able to enjoy their beauty :(
                <br>
                    Therefore, if you wanted to bring some, we'd like to ask you to donate to <a href="https://dara.kz/">DARA Foundation </a> instead.
                    <br>
                    We'll have a box to collect donations in any currency after the wedding ceremony and will arrange their safe transport to DARA in Almaty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The mission of the Dara Foundation is the implementation of projects aimed at helping childrenâ€™s health facilities, orphanages, and boarding schools for children with disabilities.
                <br>
                    Dara carries out its activities to improve living conditions and expand opportunities for development of orphans, children with disabilities and sick children.
